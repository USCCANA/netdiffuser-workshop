## Outline

-   Introduction to the network diffusion model and the motivation for
    netdiffuseR

-   The classic datasets (MI, BF & KFP)

-   Simulating diffusion with netdiffuseR

-   Data management features

-   The FCTC study -- multiple networks both static and dynamic

## Acknowledgements

NetDiffuseR was created with the support of grant R01 CA157577 from the
National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health.  

It has benefited from input provided by participants of the Center for
Applied Network Analysis at the University of Southern California

## Motivation for NetdifusseR

Build a platform in which:

-   network exposure terms can be easily calculated and compared;

-   other diffusion network terms can be created (e.g., Moran's I,
    infectiousness, susceptibility);

-   multiple dynamic and static networks can be analyzed simultaneously;

-   Graphical displays of diffusion processes can be made;

-   Statistical tests both conventional and new can be conducted;

-   Integrate network diffusion models with other analytic approaches;

-   and more.

## Diffusion Networks

-   Unique set of studies that combine social network data with
    behavioral data

    -   Typically have data from zero or low prevalence to saturation or
        high prevalence.

    -   Multiple time points presents unique opportunities and
        challenges.

    -   Data often do not include dis-adoption but the model accounts
        for it.

-   Network data may be static or dynamic.

-   Can have one or multiple networks

-   Model multiple behaviors simultaneously (e.g., tobacco & alcohol,
    awareness & adoption, VHS & Betamax)

-   Because we combine networks and behavior

    -   Can have people in the network with no adoption data

    -   People with adoption data but not in the network

## Diffusion of Innovations

-   Explains how new ideas and practices spread within and between
    communities.

-   One of the oldest and richest social science theories.

-   Many factors influence diffusion

    -   Spatial

    -   Economic

    -   Cultural

    -   Developmental

    -   Biological

    -   Etc.

-   One of the most significant is social networks

## Other Features: Extending Exposure

-   Thresholds

-   Indirect exposures

-   Attribute weighted

-   Network weighted (i.e., centrality)

## Reconfigure to Event History Data

![](figs/slides-event-data.png){width="80%"}

## Medical Innovation (Coleman, Katz, & Menzel, 1966),

Data collected from physicians in the 4 cities in Illinois in 1955
(Galesburg, Bloomington, Quincy, & Peoria). 125 MDs interviewed about
the medical practice characteristics:

-   3 network questions: advice, discussion, and friends.

-   Adoption data collected by analyzing the prescription records of
    local pharmacies on the first 3 days of each month.

## Brazilian Farmers (Rogers, Ascroft, & Röling, 1970)

As part of the USAID funded 3-country study, farmers in selected
villages in India, Nigeria, and Brazil were interviewed about their
farming practices, use of media, and other personal characteristics.
Networks were measured by asking:

-   their three best friends, (2) the three most influential people in
    their community, (3) the three most influential people regarding
    various farm innovations, and (4) the best person to organize a
    cooperative project.

-   Adoption data were collected by asking farmers when they first
    planted hybrid seed corn

## Korean Family Planning (Rogers & Kincaid, 1981)

Scholars at Seoul National University's School of Public Health
collected data on the adoption of family planning methods among all
married women of child-bearing age in 25 Korean villages in 1973
(N=1,047). Networks Network data were obtained by asking respondents to
name five people from whom

-   they sought advice about (1) family planning, (2) general
    information,

(3) abortion, (4) health, (5) the purchase of consumer goods, and (6)
    children's education.

-   Adoption data were obtained by asking respondents to state the year
    they first used a modern family planning method.

## Simulating diffusion

-   Seeds:
    -   Type (central, bridging, marginal, random, etc.)
    -   Size (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%)
-   Network structure:
    -   Random
    -   Small world
    -   Empirical
    -   Scale-free (centralized)
    -   Attribute-based (e.g., homophily)
-   Threshold distribution:
    -   Uniform
    -   Normal (varying variance)
    -   Skewed
    -   Beta
-   Mechanism:
    -   Cohesion
    -   Structural equivalence
    -   Indirect ties
    -   Attribute-based (e.g., homophilous more persuasive)
-   Adoption behavior:
    -   No-disadoption
    -   Disadoption
    -   Conflicting behaviors (perhaps coded as -1,0, 1)
    -   Incorporate uncertainty

## Reading Data Challenges

-   Merging attribute and network data

    -   Nominated but no attribute data

    -   Attribute data no network data

-   Data file formats

    -   Single flat file

    -   2 files: edgelist and attribute file (flat)

    -   Cohort studies: 1 file separate waves of data

## Formats

-   Survey Data (static & dynamic)

-   Edge-list and Attribute data

-   Panel Data

-   STATNET, Igraph, ....

## Input Types: Single Flat File

-   Flat File with IDs, Nodelist, and Time of Adoption
-   Typically a retrospective study
-   Examples, Medical Innovation, Korean Family Planning; Brazilian
    Farmers

![](figs/slides-single-flat.png){width="40%"}

## Input Types: Double Files

-   Files will have mostly matching IDs
-   One or both files may contain time information
-   Edgelist may also, potentially, contain values or spell information

![](figs/slides-double-files.png){width="80%"}

## Input Types: Classic Cohort/Longitudinal

-   IDs and Nodelist Network data
-   Behavior is typically binary (e.g., ever smoked) or potentially
    valued (e.g., \# of cigarettes
-   Examples SNS
