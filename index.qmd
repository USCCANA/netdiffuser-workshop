**Welcome to the netdiffuseR @ Sunbelt 2025 workshop!** This workshop will introduce you to the [netdiffuseR package](https://github.com/USCCANA/netdiffuseR), which we have been developing since 2015.  Workshop materials can be downloaded from <https://github.com/USCCANA/netdiffuser-workshop>. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCCANA/netdiffuseR/refs/heads/master/man/figures/netdiffuser-logo.png" style="max-width:300px;width:50%;" align="right">

Sections:

1. [Diffusion Theory](1-theory.qmd)
2. [Reading data](2-read.qmd)
3. [Visualization](3-visualization.qmd)
4. [Statistical inference](4-stats.qmd)
5. [Simulations pt.1](5-sim.qmd)
6. [Simulations pt.2](6-multi-and-dis.qmd)

In [Misc](0-getstarted.qmd) section, you can find 

1. a *Quick nâ€™ Dirty Introduction to R*, 
2. a brief introduction to netdiffuseR package, and
3. an example of a classical diffusion analysis.

From the description:

> Empirical statistical analysis, visualization and simulation of diffusion and contagion processes on networks. The package implements algorithms for calculating network diffusion statistics such as transmission rate, hazard rates, exposure models, network threshold levels, infectiousness (contagion), and susceptibility. The package is inspired by work published in Valente, et al., (2015) DOI:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.10.001; Valente (1995) ISBN:9781881303213, Myers (2000) DOI:10.1086/303110, Iyengar and others (2011) DOI:10.1287/mksc.1100.0566, Burt (1987) DOI:10.1086/228667; among others.
